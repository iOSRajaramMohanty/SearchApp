# SearchApp

Mobile Developer Practical Test

Brief: Develop a last.fm search mobile app on your platform of choice.
Features: The user must be able to search {artist, album or songs} API provided below (decide which one you prefer to implement) for a keyword, with results shown to the user. The user can select an {artist, album or song} to show basic details.
At a minimum the project should:
Show the {artist, album or song} search results to the user
Show information about the {artist, album or songs} & any artwork available
If user selects a result then display additional basic information about the {artist,
album or song}. This view does not need to be exhaustive. Use a local GIT repository for version control.
The app should be written in an appropriate version of Swift (iOS) or Java (Android). You are free to use any open source libraries or frameworks if you wish to.
The UI and UX of the app are open for the candidate to decide. The look & feel of the app will not be scored, however the implementation will be used to gauge the candidateâ€™s knowledge of the platform.
Submission: Please ZIP your local GIT repository containing your working project excluding any built artefacts (<your name>.zip) & upload to a Google Drive location & provide a shareable link to your recruiter.
